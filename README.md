# knitr4education
KnitR Examples used for a seminar at the University RPTU to create tailored individual worksheet according to the prerequisites of the learners.

## Lanuage of R-Markdown Documents
The primary language for the seminar is German at the RPTU but the code chunks can be used in other languages as well. To be able to translate and separate the course material in other languages subdirectory are created 
* `de/` R-Markdown filses in [german language](https://github.com/niebert/knitr4education/tree/main/de)
* `en/` R-Markdown filses in [english language](https://github.com/niebert/knitr4education/tree/main/en)

## Sample Data for Learning 
* The subfolder `data/` contains CSV-files that are used for demotration purpose. After finalizing your course you might want to run that locally on your computer with real data.
* [guru99-edu](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu) provided sample data for learning R and KnitR (see [Sample Data for R-Programming](https://www.github.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming) )
* If you fork the sample data repository provide a reference to source similar to the [following example repository](https://www.github.com/niebert/R-Programming)
