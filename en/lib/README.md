## Library Folder
This folder contains the R code files that can be used in multiple R Markdown files.
Store the defined functions in a separate file makes code reusable and maintenance of the library is much easier,
if functions are optimized or improved.

### Version 0.4
First public release to show the principle of external code elements.
